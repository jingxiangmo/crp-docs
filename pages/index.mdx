# Introduction
**Create-ROS-Project (CRP) is the simplest and fastest way to create and manage your Robotics Operating System (ROS) projects.**

Installing and setting up ROS projects can be complex and annoying, especially for beginners. **CRP is a standardized project initialization tool that aims to simplify ROS installation, project setup, project structure standardization, dependency management, pre-configure simulations, and deployment.** Using proven practices and technologies for ROS like Docker, rosdep, colcon, and etc. CRP aims to make starting your next robotics project fast and easy.

## Get Started
<Steps>

    ### Step 1: install and build from source

    ```bash copy
    git clone https://github.com/jingxiangmo/create-ros-project && cd create-ros-project && go build .
    # add to path
    echo "export PATH=\$PATH:$(pwd)" >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

    ### Step 2: run the CLI application

    Option A: from the project directory

    ```bash copy
    # navigate to the directory containing the executable
    ./create-ros-project
    ```

    Option B: if the executable is in your PATH
    ```
    create-ros-project
    ```
</Steps>


## Current Features
- **One Command Install:** CRP lets you install ROS on your computer without having to check documentations, so you can focus on code, not build projects.
- **Project Templates:** CRP templates gives you starter templates with Docker, publishers, subscribers, services, and actions setup and get started right away with you new project.


## Roadmap Features
- Cross-platform compatibility checker for all dependencies of the project
- ROS distribution versioning updates
- Customizable project templates
