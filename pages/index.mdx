[video goes here]


## Get Started
<Steps>

    ### Step 1

    ```bash copy
    apt install create-ros-project
    ```

    ```bash copy
    create-ros-project
    ```
</Steps>

## Advantages
- **Fast:** [one line install and setup for new projects or existing profjects]
- **Simple:** [remove learning curve, never have to interact with docker etc.]
- **Scalable:** [could be used in cross platform]

## Key Features
CRP aims to significantly improve the ROS developer experience by solving the ROS dependency management and compatibility problem to reduce the learning curve and project setup time for newcomers and teams.

- **One Command Install:** CRP lets you get started in seconds and to focus on code, not build projects.
- **Dependency Management:** With 1234 combinations of ROS distros and OS, CRP helps you avoid version mismatches.
- **Templates:** CRP templates accelerates the process of creating new packages and assist in delivery quality and standard code.
